Thank you for your interest in myself and this website, I took enjoyment in the developing process and acquired a myriad of knowledge and tools along the way. My mission for this project was to develop a high quality website and showcase my creative abilities. To do so, I used Node, React, Parcel, Sass, and a custom ES-Lint AirBNB configuration for clean and concise code. This website is fully responsive across all screen sizes, without the use of a single media query, and maintain utmost browser compatibility. I was able to maximize performance, accessibility, best practices, and search engine optimization by utilizing the Lighthouse module. The final audit score and details are outlined below. Further, Google analytics informative data collection will support continuous improvement.
